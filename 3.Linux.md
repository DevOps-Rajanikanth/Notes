when a user is created , a group with same name is created

permissions

```bash
drwxr-xr-x 1 pramo 197609         0 Mar 31  2022  Autodesk/
lrwxrwxrwx 1 pramo 197609        30 Oct 29  2022 'Application Data' -> /c/Users/pramo/AppData/Roaming/

examples  

1. `chmod g-rw sample` - Revokes read and write permissions for the group associated with the file "sample".
2. `chmod o-r sample` - Revokes read permissions for all other users (non-owner, non-group) for the file "sample".
3. `chmod ugo+r sample` - Grants read permissions to the owner, group, and all other users for the file "sample".
4. `chmod go+x sample` - Grants execute permissions to the group and all other users for the file "sample".

**recursive access modification inside files**

chmod g-w -R devops

This command recursively removes write permissions for the group from all files and directories within the "devops" directory:

```
chmod g-w -R devops
```

IQ

requirement 
```
set permissions as follows
u-rwx
g-r
o-0
how to set it
since
r = 4
w = 2
x = 1

chmod ugo(values added) <file or dir>

chmod 740 devops
or
chmod u=rwx,g=r,o= devops
```

In the ugo format, the permissions "740" for the "devops" file would be represented as follows:

- **Owner**: has read, write, and execute permissions (7)
- **Group**: has read permissions (4)
- **Others**: has no permissions (0)

Therefore, in ugo format, "740" would be represented as:

```

chmod u=rwx,g=r,o= devops
```


**User managemet**

1. **Adding Users**: The `useradd` command is used to add new users to the system. For example:

   ```bash
   sudo useradd username
   ```

   This creates a new user with the specified username.

2. **Setting Passwords**: After adding a user, you need to set a password for them using the `passwd` command:
3. 
   ```bash
   sudo passwd username
   ```

   This will prompt you to enter and confirm the new password for the user.

   to check if user is created check file /etc/passwd file

   Certainly! Here's the shortened version:

1. `id username` - Get information about a specific user.
2. `getent group` - List all groups on the system and their members.


**to enable password authentication**

navigate to /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
set value of PasswordAuthentication to yes

restart sshd by systemctl restart sshd

checking file config 
sshd -t == this checks for file config errors






4. **Modifying User Attributes**: You can modify user account attributes using the `usermod` command. For example, to change a user's home directory:
   ```
   sudo usermod -d /path/to/new/home username
   ```

5. **Deleting Users**: To delete a user account, you can use the `userdel` command:
   ```
   sudo userdel username
   ```
   This removes the user account but doesn't delete the user's home directory by default.

6. **Managing Groups**: Users can be members of one or more groups, which can be useful for granting permissions. The `groupadd`, `groupmod`, and `groupdel` commands are used to manage groups.

7. **Listing Users and Groups**: You can list all users on the system using the `cat /etc/passwd` command or `getent passwd`. Similarly, you can list groups with `cat /etc/group` or `getent group`.

8. **Switching Users**: You can switch to another user account using the `su` command. For example, to switch to the root user:
   ```
   su -
   ```
   You'll be prompted to enter the root password.

9. **Sudo Access**: Users can be granted sudo (superuser) privileges to perform administrative tasks. This is typically configured in the `/etc/sudoers` file.

10. **File Permissions**: Linux file permissions and ownership also play a role in user management. The `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp` commands are used to change file permissions, ownership, and group ownership respectively.

11. **Authentication and Authorization**: Linux uses various authentication mechanisms like PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) and authorization policies configured in files like `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/group`, and `/etc/sudoers`.

Remember to use these commands with caution, especially when dealing with administrative tasks. Improper user management can compromise system security.


To enable password authentication in the SSH daemon configuration file (`sshd_config`), you need to locate the file and edit it. The SSH daemon configuration file is usually located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

Once you locate the file, look for the line that says `#PasswordAuthentication yes`. If it's commented out with a `#` at the beginning, remove the `#` to uncomment it. If the line doesn't exist, add it to the file.

Here's how you can do it in one line using a command-line text editor like `sed`:

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/#PasswordAuthentication yes/PasswordAuthentication yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

This command searches for the line containing `#PasswordAuthentication yes` and replaces it with `PasswordAuthentication yes` in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file.

After making the change, remember to restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo service ssh restart
```

Now, password authentication should be enabled in SSH.


### Group 20

creating a group

```bash
groupadd <group-name>
```
check created group by
```bash
getent group
```
this will list your group name

- every user will have a primary group and secondary group
```bash
usermod -g devops ramesh
```
why linux user has primary and secondary groups

In Linux, a user can belong to multiple groups. The primary group is the group that is associated with the user's account by default. Every user has one primary group, which is specified in the `/etc/passwd` file. This primary group is typically used as the default group ownership for files created by the user.

However, a user can also belong to additional groups, known as secondary groups. Secondary groups allow users to have access to resources and permissions associated with those groups in addition to their primary group. Secondary groups are specified in the `/etc/group` file.

Having both primary and secondary groups allows for more flexible access control and resource sharing in a Linux system. For example, a user can collaborate with members of different groups on projects by being a member of multiple groups simultaneously. Additionally, administrators can grant specific permissions to users based on their secondary group memberships.

Overall, primary and secondary groups provide a way to manage access to resources and facilitate collaboration among users in a Linux environment.
